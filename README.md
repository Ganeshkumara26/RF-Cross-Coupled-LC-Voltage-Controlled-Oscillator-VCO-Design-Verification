# RF-Cross-Coupled-LC-Voltage-Controlled-Oscillator-VCO-Design-Verification
Designed a 10 GHz differential cross-coupled NMOS VCO in GPDK045 with a 20% tuning range (9–11 GHz) for automotive radar applications.


Implemented a hybrid tuning topology using a 3-bit switched-capacitor bank for coarse steps and MOS varactors for fine continuous frequency control.


Modeled high-Q 3-turn spiral inductors in Ansys HFSS to extract S-parameters, accounting for physical substrate losses and center-tap biasing.


Created a symmetric, grid-based layout in Cadence Virtuoso, successfully clearing all DRC/LVS requirements to ensure manufacturability.


Validated design through Post-Layout Extraction (PEX), achieving a phase noise of -105 dBc/Hz at 1 MHz offset and a Figure of Merit (FoM) of -185 dB.
